  <h3>Who is Montessori Match for?</h3>
  <p>
    Montessori Match is for anyone who is involved in hiring lead teachers at a Montessori school and wants a teacher who is a perfect fit. This app is also great for trained Montessori teachers ready to find the perfect school they can call “home” and make all their own.
  </p>
  <h3>Can I use the app if I am outside of the US?</h3>
  <p>
    Right now the Montessori Match app is exclusively for the United States. However, as we develop the app and work out the kinks we will expand the app for increased global access. If you live outside the US and would like to use Montessori Match, please <a href="mailto:hello@montessorimatch.com">EMAIL US</a> to let us know!
  </p>
  <h3>Can I hire assistant teachers or administrators on the app?</h3>
  <p>
    Currently, Montessori Match only functions for the hiring of certified lead teachers. As we develop the app we will slowly expand to offer profile opportunities for other key school employees.

  <h3>Why is Montessori Match free? What’s the catch?</h3>
  <p>
    There’s no catch, we promise! Right now we are just so grateful that people are building profiles and helping us learn how to create the best hiring service possible. At some point, we will begin charging for matches. For right now, we just want to serve the community and learn as much as we can!
